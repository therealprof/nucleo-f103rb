nucleo-f103rb
=============

_nucleo-f103rb_ contains a basic board support packet for the fabulous [STM
Nucleo-F103RB][] microcontroller board to write firmwares using Rust. This
standard format board contains 2 buttons and 2 LEDs as well as a number of
standard headers which can be used to connect peripherals, it even contains a
snap-off board with a capable ST-Link V2 debugging interface, so all that one
needs to get going with progamming this device is:

* A STM Nucleo-F103RB board
* A computer (macOS and Linux work perfectly, Windows should work but was not tested)
* A bit of open source software
